<small>This project is done as part of the course <i>Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas</i> , lectured by Aakash N. S., and hosted on https://jovian.ai.</small>


### Context <br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The Chernobyl disaster started in 1986's April 26th, when the Chernobyl's nuclear power plant reactor caught on fire, lasting for 10 days, resulting in the unprecedented release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor. The power plant is located at 100 km from Kievin (Ukraine), but the effects of this accident reached far beyond its country borders.</div> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The three most affected countries were Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, but the accident's consequences were not limited to those territories. Several other European countries were affected by it, due to a massive atmospheric transfer of radioactive material. Until this day, the real impact of this event is still under controversy.</div> <br>

<div style="text-align: justify"> The assessment of the radionuclide intake with food and drinking water was based primarily on several measurements of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 that were performed all over Europe [1], which are the radioisotopes reported in this dataset.</div> <br>


### Dataset Content

This dataset presents concentration of Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134) and Caesium-137 (Cs-137) as aerosol particles which were measured in specific location and date. The following information is given in each column:
  -  country
  -  country code
  -  locality name
  -  lattitude (degrees.hundredths of degrees)
  -  longitude (degrees.hundredths of degrees)
  -  date (year/month/day)
  -  hour of end of sampling (hours:minutes)
  -  duration (hours.minutes)
  -  I-131 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles)
  -  Cs-134 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles)
  -  Cs-137 concentration in Bq/m3 (aerosol particles)
  
### Acknowledgments

The dataset was extracted from the REM data bank at CEC Joint Research Centre Ispra. The data was downloaded from Kaggle's data bank and is also available on the JRC Directorate for Nuclear Safety and Security.
